> **Note:** The contents of this repository are a **proof of concept** and

A minimal PEP 517 compliant build backend that uses [Conan](https://conan.io) to
build Python C/C++ extensions.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/conan-io/conan-py-build.git
cd conan-py-build
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

1. Create a `pyproject.toml` for your package:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["conan-py-build"]
build-backend = "conan_py_build.build"

[project]
name = "mypackage"
version = "0.1.0"
```

2. Create a `conanfile.py` with your C++ dependencies and build logic. Your `CMakeLists.txt` must use `install(TARGETS ... DESTINATION <package_name>)` so extensions end up in the wheel:

```python
from conan import ConanFile
from conan.tools.cmake import CMake, cmake_layout

class MyPackageConan(ConanFile):
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    generators = "CMakeToolchain", "CMakeDeps"

    def layout(self):
        cmake_layout(self)

    def requirements(self):
        self.requires("fmt/12.1.0")

    def build(self):
        cmake = CMake(self)
        cmake.configure()
        cmake.build()

    def package(self):
        cmake = CMake(self)
        cmake.install()
```

3. Build the wheel:

```bash
pip wheel . -w dist/ -vvv
```

For a complete basic working example, see the [basic example](examples/basic/).

## Configuration

Pass configuration options via `--config-settings`:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `host-profile` | Conan profile for host context | `default` |
| `build-profile` | Conan profile for build context | `default` |
| `build-dir` | Persistent build directory | temp dir |

Configure in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.conan-py-build]`:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `version.provider` | Version provider: `"file"` or `"setuptools_scm"` (see [Dynamic version](#dynamic-version)) | (none) |
| `version.file` | Path to a Python file containing `__version__ = "x.y.z"` (used when `provider = "file"`) | (none) |
| `conanfile-path` | Path to the Conan recipe (directory containing `conanfile.py` or path to the file), relative to project root | `"."` (project root) |
| `wheel.packages` | List of paths (relative to project root) of Python packages to include in the wheel; each must be a directory with `__init__.py` | `["src/<normalized_project_name>"]` |
| `sdist.include` | List of paths or patterns to add to the sdist | `[]` |
| `sdist.exclude` | List of paths or patterns to exclude from the sdist | `[]` |
| `extra-profile` | Path (relative to project root) to a Conan profile file | (none) |

### Dynamic version

Set `dynamic = ["version"]` in `[project]` (no `version` key) and configure the provider in `[tool.conan-py-build.version]`:

**From a file** — reads `__version__ = "x.y.z"` from a Python file:

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build.version]
provider = "file"
file = "src/mypackage/__init__.py"
```

**From git tags (setuptools-scm)** — resolves version from VCS tags (e.g. `v1.0.0` → `1.0.0`):

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build.version]
provider = "setuptools_scm"
```

All setuptools-scm options are configured in `[tool.conan-py-build.version.setuptools_scm]`:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `local_scheme` | Controls the local part of the version (after `+`). Set to `"no-local-version"` to strip the `+gHASH` suffix, which is required for PyPI uploads. | `setuptools-scm` default (`"node-and-date"`) |
| `version_scheme` | How the version string is constructed between tags. Common values: `"guess-next-dev"`, `"post-release"`, `"calver-by-date"`. | `setuptools-scm` default (`"guess-next-dev"`) |
| `fallback_version` | Static version string used when SCM metadata is unavailable (e.g. building from a tarball without `.git`). | (none — raises error) |
| `root` | Path to the SCM root relative to `pyproject.toml`. Only needed when the project lives in a subdirectory of the repository (e.g. monorepos). | `"."` (same directory) |
| `version_file` | Path to write the generated version file, so it is included in the sdist for builds without `.git`. | (none) |

Example with `local_scheme` and `fallback_version`:

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build.version.setuptools_scm]
local_scheme = "no-local-version"
fallback_version = "0.0.0"
```

Example for a monorepo where `.git` is one level up:

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build.version.setuptools_scm]
root = ".."
```

### License files (PEP 639)

The backend supports [PEP 639](https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/) license metadata. Set `[project].license-files` in `pyproject.toml` to a list of glob patterns (e.g. `["LICENSE"]`) to include those files in the wheel under `.dist-info/licenses/` and add `License-File` entries to METADATA and to the sdist PKG-INFO. If `license-files` is not set, no license files are included.

### Wheel packages

You can control which Python packages are included in the wheel via
`[tool.conan-py-build].wheel` in `pyproject.toml`:

- **`wheel.packages`**: list of paths (relative to the project root) that are
  Python packages to include in the wheel. Each path must be a directory inside
  the project.

If `wheel.packages` is not set, the backend includes a single package at
`src/<normalized_project_name>` (e.g. `src/mypackage` for a project named
`mypackage`).

**Conan recipe path.** If your recipe lives outside the project root (e.g.
`subfolder/conanfile.py`), set `conanfile-path` so the backend runs
`conan source`, `conan build` and `conan export-pkg` on that path:

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build]
conanfile-path = "subfolder"
```

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build.wheel]
packages = ["src/mypackage", "src/other_package"]
```

### Sdist include / exclude

You can control what goes into the source distribution (sdist) via
`[tool.conan-py-build].sdist` in `pyproject.toml`:

- **`sdist.include`**: paths to add to the sdist (e.g. files in default exclude
  like `build/`, or extra dirs like `["docs/"]`).
- **`sdist.exclude`**: paths or patterns to remove from the sdist (e.g. default
  includes you don't want, like `["README.md"]`, or `["tests"]`).

By default the sdist includes `pyproject.toml`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `conanfile.py`,
`cmake/`, `src/`, `include/`, README and LICENSE, and excludes `__pycache__`,
`*.pyc`, `.git`, `build`, `dist` and the like.

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build.sdist]
include = ["docs/", "misc/"]
exclude = [".github", "scripts", "README.md"]
```

### Profiles

Host and build profiles are set via `--config-settings` (see table above):
`host-profile` and `build-profile`, defaulting to Conan’s `default` profile.
Example with Jinja profiles from `examples/profiles/` (`include(default)` +
wheel tags. Set **`CONAN_CPYTHON_VERSION`** to the full version, e.g.
`3.12.12`):

```bash
export CONAN_CPYTHON_VERSION=3.12.12
pip wheel . --no-build-isolation \
    --config-settings="host-profile=examples/profiles/linux.jinja" \
    --config-settings="build-dir=./build" \
    -w dist/
```

**Extra profile in `pyproject.toml`.** You can add one extra Conan profile file
via `[tool.conan-py-build].extra-profile`. It is **composed on top of** the
profiles applied first (default or those passed via `-C`). The extra profile is
applied last, so it lets you override values. For example, if your extension
needs at least C++17, put `compiler.cppstd=17` in a profile file and set
`extra-profile = "cpp17.profile"` so that override is applied on top of the
default or CI profile.

Keys: `extra-profile`, `extra-profile-host`, `extra-profile-build`,
`extra-profile-all`. Path relative to project root.

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build]
extra-profile = "cpp17.profile"
```

### Conan home and default profile

The backend **always uses Conan’s default home** (e.g. `~/.conan2`), or the one set via 
`CONAN_HOME` or the `.conanrc` file.

By default the backend uses Conan's **default** profile. To use an autodetected
profile, set
**`CONAN_PY_BUILD_PROFILE_AUTODETECT=1`** (or `true` / `yes`).

## Examples

See the [examples/](examples/) directory for complete working examples:

- **[basic](examples/basic/)**: Simple Python extension using the `fmt` library
- **[basic-pybind11](examples/basic-pybind11/)**: Python extension using pybind11 (with dynamic version from `__init__.py`)
- **[external-sources](examples/external-sources/)**: C++ code fetched in `source()`

## Development

To try changes against a project that uses this backend (e.g. one of the
examples), install the backend in editable mode and build with no isolation so
it uses your local copy:

```bash
pip install -e .   # from the conan-py-build repo root
cd examples/basic  # or your own project
pip wheel . --no-build-isolation -w dist/
```

## Running tests

Install the build backend in editable mode with dev dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```
