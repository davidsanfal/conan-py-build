A minimal PEP 517 compliant build backend that uses [Conan](https://conan.io) to
build Python C/C++ extensions.

## Installation

From [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/conan-py-build/) (typical use):

```bash
pip install conan-py-build
```

To work on this repository or try the current `main`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/conan-io/conan-py-build.git
cd conan-py-build
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

1. Create a `pyproject.toml` for your package:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["conan-py-build"]
build-backend = "conan_py_build.build"

[project]
name = "mypackage"
version = "0.1.0"
```

2. Create a `conanfile.py` with your C++ dependencies and build logic. Your `CMakeLists.txt` must use `install(TARGETS ... DESTINATION <package_name>)` so extensions end up in the wheel:

```python
from conan import ConanFile
from conan.tools.cmake import CMake, cmake_layout

class MyPackageConan(ConanFile):
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    generators = "CMakeToolchain", "CMakeDeps"

    def layout(self):
        cmake_layout(self)

    def requirements(self):
        self.requires("fmt/12.1.0")

    def build(self):
        cmake = CMake(self)
        cmake.configure()
        cmake.build()

    def package(self):
        cmake = CMake(self)
        cmake.install()
```

3. Build the wheel:

```bash
pip wheel . -w dist/ -vvv
```

For a complete basic working example, see the [basic example](examples/basic/).

## Configuration

Pass configuration options via `--config-settings`:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `host-profile` | Conan profile for host context | `default` |
| `build-profile` | Conan profile for build context | `default` |
| `build-dir` | Persistent build directory | temp dir |

Configure options in `pyproject.toml` (nested under `[tool.conan-py-build]`):

| Option | TOML section | Description | Default |
|--------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| `conanfile-path` | `[tool.conan-py-build]` | Path to the Conan recipe (directory containing `conanfile.py` or path to the file), relative to project root | `"."` (project root) |
| `extra-profile`, `extra-profile-host`, … | `[tool.conan-py-build]` | Extra Conan profile file(s) — see [Profiles](#profiles) | (none) |
| `version.file` | `[tool.conan-py-build.version]` | Python file containing `__version__ = "x.y.z"` (see [Dynamic version](#dynamic-version)) | (none) |
| `version.provider` | `[tool.conan-py-build.version]` | Set to `"setuptools_scm"` for version from git tags. Mutually exclusive with `version.file`. | (none) |
| `packages` | `[tool.conan-py-build.wheel]` | List of paths (relative to project root) of Python packages in the wheel. Each path must be a directory with `__init__.py` | `["src/<normalized_name>"]` |
| `install-dir` | `[tool.conan-py-build.wheel]` | Subdirectory inside the wheel where CMake install artifacts are placed | `""` (wheel root) |
| `py-api` | `[tool.conan-py-build.wheel]` | Stable ABI / Limited API tag — see [Stable ABI](#stable-abi--limited-api) | `""` (auto-detect) |
| `include` / `exclude` | `[tool.conan-py-build.sdist]` | Paths or glob patterns to add to or remove from the sdist | `[]` / `[]` |

### Dynamic version

Set `dynamic = ["version"]` in `[project]` (no `version` key) and configure the version source in `[tool.conan-py-build.version]`:

**From a file** — reads `__version__ = "x.y.z"` from a Python file:

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build.version]
file = "src/mypackage/__init__.py"
```

**From git tags (setuptools-scm)** — resolves version from VCS tags (e.g. `v1.0.0` → `1.0.0`):

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build.version]
provider = "setuptools_scm"
```

The `setuptools-scm` options are configured in `[tool.setuptools_scm]` — see the
[setuptools-scm docs](https://setuptools-scm.readthedocs.io/) for available options.

> **Note:** `version.file` and `provider = "setuptools_scm"` are mutually exclusive.

### License files (PEP 639)

The backend supports [PEP 639](https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/) license metadata. Set `[project].license-files` in `pyproject.toml` to a list of glob patterns (e.g. `["LICENSE"]`) to include those files in the wheel under `.dist-info/licenses/` and add `License-File` entries to METADATA and to the sdist PKG-INFO. If `license-files` is not set, no license files are included.

### Wheel packages

You can control which Python packages are included in the wheel via
`[tool.conan-py-build.wheel]` in `pyproject.toml`:

- **`packages`**: list of paths (relative to the project root) that are Python
  packages to include in the wheel. Each path must be a directory inside the
  project.

If `packages` is not set, the backend includes a single package at
`src/<normalized_project_name>` (hyphens in the project name become underscores,
e.g. `my-package` → `src/my_package`).

**Conan recipe path.** If your recipe lives outside the project root (e.g.
`subfolder/conanfile.py`), set `conanfile-path` so the backend runs
`conan source`, `conan build` and `conan export-pkg` on that path:

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build]
conanfile-path = "subfolder"
```

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build.wheel]
packages = ["src/mypackage", "src/other_package"]
```

See [basic-pybind11](examples/basic-pybind11/) for multiple packages (`python/...` + `src/...`).

### Stable ABI / Limited API

Set `wheel.py-api` to build wheels targeting Python's
[Stable ABI](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html), producing an `abi3`
wheel that works across multiple Python versions without recompilation:

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build.wheel]
py-api = "cp312"   # wheel works on CPython 3.12+
```

- **`"cpXY"`** (e.g. `"cp312"`): Stable ABI → `cpXY-abi3-<platform>`. Requires
  building on CPython ≥ target version. Ignored on incompatible interpreters.
- **`""`** (default): auto-detect from the current interpreter.

Your C/C++ extension must be compiled against the Limited API (e.g. nanobind's
`STABLE_ABI`, or pybind11's `Py_LIMITED_API`).

### Sdist include / exclude

You can control what goes into the source distribution (sdist) via
`[tool.conan-py-build.sdist]` in `pyproject.toml`:

- **`sdist.include`**: paths to add to the sdist (e.g. files in default exclude
  like `build/`, or extra dirs like `["docs/"]`).
- **`sdist.exclude`**: paths or patterns to remove from the sdist (e.g. default
  includes you don't want, like `["README.md"]`, or `["tests"]`).

By default the sdist includes `pyproject.toml`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `conanfile.py`,
`cmake/`, `src/`, `include/`, README and LICENSE, and excludes `__pycache__`,
`*.pyc`, `.git`, `build`, `dist` and the like.

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build.sdist]
include = ["docs/", "misc/"]
exclude = [".github", "scripts", "README.md"]
```

### Profiles

Host and build profiles are set via `--config-settings` (see table above):
`host-profile` and `build-profile`, defaulting to Conan’s `default` profile.
Example with Jinja profiles under `examples/profiles/` that use `include(default)`
and set `WHEEL_*` for wheel tags. Set **`CONAN_CPYTHON_VERSION`** to the full
interpreter version, e.g. `3.12.12`:

```bash
export CONAN_CPYTHON_VERSION=3.12.12
pip wheel . --no-build-isolation \
    --config-settings="host-profile=examples/profiles/linux.jinja" \
    --config-settings="build-dir=./build" \
    -w dist/
```

**Extra profile in `pyproject.toml`.** You can add one extra Conan profile file
via `[tool.conan-py-build].extra-profile`. It is **composed on top of** the
profiles applied first (default or those passed via `-C`). The extra profile is
applied last, so it lets you override values. For example, if your extension
needs at least C++17, put `compiler.cppstd=17` in a profile file and set
`extra-profile = "cpp17.profile"` so that override is applied on top of the
default or CI profile.

Keys: `extra-profile`, `extra-profile-host`, `extra-profile-build`,
`extra-profile-all`. Path relative to project root.

```toml
[tool.conan-py-build]
extra-profile = "cpp17.profile"
```

### Conan home and default profile

The backend **always uses Conan’s default home** (e.g. `~/.conan2`), or the one set via 
`CONAN_HOME` or the `.conanrc` file.

By default the backend uses Conan's **default** profile. To use an autodetected
profile, set
**`CONAN_PY_BUILD_PROFILE_AUTODETECT=1`** (or `true` / `yes`).

### Support for shared library builds

If your extension links to shared libs from Conan, the backend collects them
during the build and merges that output into the **wheel staging root** next to
your packages (RPATH is fixed on the extension to point at the parent directory so
those libs resolve).

## Examples

See the [examples/](examples/) directory for complete working examples:

- **[basic](examples/basic/)**: Extension with `fmt`, recipe in `conan/` via `conanfile-path`
- **[basic-pybind11](examples/basic-pybind11/)**: pybind11 + `fmt` (dynamic version from `__init__.py`, custom `wheel.packages`, PEP 639 license files)
- **[basic-nanobind](examples/basic-nanobind/)**: nanobind + `fmt`, with `extra-profile` for C++17
- **[external-sources](examples/external-sources/)**: pybind11. C++ dependency fetched in `source()`
- **[cibw-example](examples/cibw-example/)**: pybind11 + [cibuildwheel](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/) (profiles under `examples/cibw-example/profiles/`, see CI workflow)

## Development

To try changes against a project that uses this backend (e.g. one of the
examples), install the backend in editable mode and build with no isolation so
it uses your local copy:

```bash
pip install -e .   # from the conan-py-build repo root
cd examples/basic  # or your own project
pip wheel . --no-build-isolation -w dist/
```

## Running tests

Install the build backend in editable mode with dev dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```
